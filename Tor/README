1. compile & install Tor

cd tor-0.2.5.10
./configure
make
make install

2. compile and execute enclave_process

cd enclave_Tor
gcc -Wall enclave_process.c -o enclave_process -lcrypto -lssl -lpthread -L./ libor-crypto.a libor.a -lm
./enclave_process

3. Configurating Chutney

cd chutney
./chutney configure networks/basic


===========================================

[Remaining works]

1. Modifying chutney
 - Currently, it uses identity_key, signing_key, certificate by reading a file written by tor-gencert
 - Through our modification, we save them as a data structure, not file.
 - communicate with enclave_process

2. Find and modify tor code
 - After configuration is done, we will start tor using chutney
  -> ./chutney start networks/basic
 - While executing, if several functions requires such data structures, we have to change them communcating with
   enclave_process.

3. Exit nodes
 - Summarize the attack scenario
 - Saving keys while relay creation (while configuration)
 - Find operations which requires secret onion key, secret_id_key or so on..
