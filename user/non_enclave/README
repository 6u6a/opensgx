Hey~ Mingwei :)
use this test case for your remote attestation implementation..

1. run test/simple-attest first -> it busy waits ping message from the non_enclave
2. run non_enclave/attest_nonEnc -> it sends ping message to simple-attest
3. simple-attest will send result of sgx_report
4. attest_nonEnc receives it and print result.


FYI... we don't have thread supports in Enclave, so have some problem when we have
recv and send back to back. Make sure that process has some waits before calling send
to make other process be ready to recv.
check non_enclave/network_nonEnc & test/simple_network :)
